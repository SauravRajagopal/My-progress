The concept of “hospitality” started from the inherent human trait of caring for other people and grew to become one of the most important industries of the modern age. The hospitality culture is now indispensable and travels much beyond the horizon of time and space. This industry has undergone a tremendous metamorphosis over the last couple of decades leading to a higher amount of competition. This creates a need for new entrepreneurs who wish to plunge, to be supported by no one but the best. A higher emphasis on Quality Management, Customer relationship and a constant change factor are some of the things synonymous to this industry today. To keep up this space, professional consultancy, planning and implementation are an absolute must.<br><br><br>
